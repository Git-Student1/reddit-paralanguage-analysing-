aboutthednm,204693,"I caught two boxes worth of pikipeks with rare markings (not the common ""uncommon"" / weather / lunchtime / whatever marks) while looking for shines. I traded all but one away through surprise trading, I received almost 50% of genned crap:

I usually don't care because I just release them immediately, I'm just a little bummed out that the Pikipeks didn't go to real trainers. A bunch of other people had the same idea as me and I got some Starlys and Fletchlings with marks in return, which was nice. But damn man, close to 50% of absolutely irredeemable craptastic advertising for shady bs is rough.

Whoever is in charge of the online servers needs to step up their nickname filter list. I usually send a message to support as well just so they are aware of what's going on in their games. They seem pretty indifferent and just apologize for the experience. Yeah great, now add those websites to your server-side filter list already and Shadow-ban these Pokemon from surprise trading. That would help a little.

Also a heads up, you can't change the nickname of any traded Pok√©mon unless it used to belong to your Trainer in that game. So as example, you can't change a Pok√©mon'd nickname from your Sword save file if you transfer it to your Shield Save file",[],0.8868

I do trade some pretty cool stuff, the kind of Pokemon which I would like to receive for myself. I honestly don't know why these trade bot accounts don't get shut down, they are being pretty obvious about it.

Roughly 40% of the pokemon in my boxes are someone else's from surprise trades, so I do take care of the legitimate ones. Some of my favourite Pokemon came through surprise trades like ""Comfey the serene"" or ""Baxcalibur the stern"". Although ""Pikipek the peckish"" with the lunchtime mark is pretty fantastic itself, lol.

Bluegallade7,13902,"I'll explain since the other person is being rude about it. Foul play is a move that works best if the user has a lower attack stat than the opponent, so in this case a golden bottle cap maximises the attack IV/stat worsening Foul play's effective damage. Similarly trick room is better for slow Pok√©mon, maximising their Speed IV can make them act out of order after trick room is active. 

Regardless, to call gold bottle caps the worst is an exaggerating as it's only niche cases where Pok√©mon want minimal stats instead of maximum.",[],-0.802

CreamEfficient6343,6097,THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING! I literally showed my dad and we were both trying to figure it out üòÇ with the lack of context I was so confused. Who knew moves needed low stats.,['üòÇ'],-0.1407
CreamEfficient6343,6097,"Thank you! I usually just use attacking moves, so I had no clue what those moves are. Very interesting!",[],0.1564
Magimasterkarp,40110,"Actually, Foul Play is an attacking move. Uniquely among all other attacks it uses the opponents attack stat, not your own. So when your pokemon is a special attacker and thus doesn't need physical attack, it's best to have it as low as possible to reduce the damage if you happen to get hit by the attack. It's a 95 base power dark type damage, so it can super effectively hit ghost and psychic types, who are also typically more physically frail and often prefer special attacks. 

That being said, it's not that commonly used in competitive, and if you're not invested in attack and using a special attacking Mon, chances are your attack wasn't extremely high in the first place, so it's more a mostly optional optimization.

[Here](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Foul_Play_(move)) at the bottom of the page you'll find a list of names for the attack in different languages. You can check what the move is called in your game there.

With [Trick Room](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Trick_Room_(move)) though, controlling exactly how fast your Pok√©mon is is vitally important. Trick Room switches the order in which pokemon attack for 5 rounds, so the slower you are normally, the faster you are in trick room. Obviously You'd only consider using trick room if your Pokemon are already a slow species, but I've heard of people giving their Pok√©mon exactly 1 speed IV, so that they can out-speed an opponent who has the same Mon while out of trick room, and then out-slow everything else after the trick room has been set up.",[],-0.3322
CreamEfficient6343,6097,"THANK YOU! Woah this is so interesting to read! And the links were so easy to look through! For me the names are Tricherie and Distorsion, which is NOT the same as just trick room or foul play in French üôÑ thank you for compiling this! I‚Äôll use that website a lot now",['üôÑ'],0.9463
