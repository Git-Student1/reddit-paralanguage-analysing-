The way they are now its like they were already unique legendaries to begin with but now have like... A poisonous accessory.

And so design wise, making them “ugly” and “unlikable is probably the point. There are a lot of media where story’s often depict bullies as ugly, covered in pimples, greasy ah hair, bit of a gut.

ButterdemBeans,55339.0,"Most Pokémon look a bit weird when they’re first announced, and they take a bit to grow on people. Before that happens, tho, you hear a lot of folks complaining that the new Pokémon just introduced “Doesn’t feel like a Pokémon design”.

I tried to wait it out. I saw the designs back when they were first announced and thought “the hell are these? They don’t look like Pokémon. They look more like designs you’d see in a Gorillaz music video. But uglier”. 

But then I remembered that I felt the same way when Solgaleo and Lunala were announced. And now they are some of my favorite designs. I remember thinking that the Galar starters didn’t feel like Pokémon designs. But they fit into the franchise well enough, even if I’m not personally a fan.

But these 3? I waited a LONG time for them to grow on me before I formed an opinion on them. I tried using them in battle, feeding them, and playing with them in the hopes I could trick myself into liking them. I even gave them cute nicknames like Toast and Bagel and Breadstick!

Munkidori’s is ok. The general look to it with the headband poison chain, its body type, the sandals, etc. is decent. But it definitely is underwhelming, especially given it’s supposed to be a lower end legendary. This looks like a middle evolution, and not in the good way. But it works enough for its type and has some elements that almost work well.
 
And then Okidogi… Yikes. First off he looks like a bear, not a dog. Which already negatively impacts the Momotaro inspiration. But beyond that the green they chose looks like vomit and is a harsh unflattering contrast to the purple “scarf” poison chain; which is the worst looking of the loyal 3 and way to big & stiff. But beyond that the fur patterns on the body looks aimless and doesn’t help the design. And to top it off in bad “strong character” design philosophy he looks like the designed a mediocre top half and then forgot about the legs. So they just give him twig legs, making him look like a barrel chested middle aged man rather than strong fighting type.

It's just a gut instinct, but i felt like if they stuck to SwSh way of rendering, it might have improved the looks of many of the new mons introduced in SV.

If you play the story, you’d find out they’re supposed to be unlikable. I don’t like the designs either, but the DLC is pretty good!

I play and love Pokemon because of the gameplay and Pokemon themselves. Scarlet and Violet have many hit and miss designs but that didn’t deter much because I ended up putting 200 hours into it. The DLC isn’t perfect, but it’s worth it in my opinion. Ogrepon alone was enough.

BluEch0,157303.0,"Prior to Gen 6, it was chosen via mathematical algorithm. It’s why so many ugly or non-impactful shinies (barf green, barely different purple, hardly noticeable yellow) show up in early gens - no one chose to make barf green espeon, it just happened because it’s original sprite was a certain shade of pink. 

Gen 6 onward, when we started using 3d models instead of sprites, the algorithm I guess was scrapped or didn’t work on texture files the same way so shinies were chosen with intent. It’s why we got awesome shinies like white mega Gengar or funeral dress mega gardevoire. 

More recent shinies tho, while presumably still chosen by hand, feel like they’re trying to recapture that old Gen 1 feel of some having awesome shinies while others are awful or unnoticeable.",[],0.8598
