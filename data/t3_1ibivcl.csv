I tried to wait it out. I saw the designs back when they were first announced and thought ‚Äúthe hell are these? They don‚Äôt look like Pok√©mon. They look more like designs you‚Äôd see in a Gorillaz music video. But uglier‚Äù. 

But then I remembered that I felt the same way when Solgaleo and Lunala were announced. And now they are some of my favorite designs. I remember thinking that the Galar starters didn‚Äôt feel like Pok√©mon designs. But they fit into the franchise well enough, even if I‚Äôm not personally a fan.

But these 3? I waited a LONG time for them to grow on me before I formed an opinion on them. I tried using them in battle, feeding them, and playing with them in the hopes I could trick myself into liking them. I even gave them cute nicknames like Toast and Bagel and Breadstick!

But it definitely is underwhelming, especially given it‚Äôs supposed to be a lower end legendary. This looks like a middle evolution, and not in the good way. But it works enough for its type and has some elements that almost work well.
 
And then Okidogi‚Ä¶ Yikes. First off he looks like a bear, not a dog. Which already negatively impacts the Momotaro inspiration. But beyond that the green they chose looks like vomit and is a harsh unflattering contrast to the purple ‚Äúscarf‚Äù poison chain; which is the worst looking of the loyal 3 and way to big & stiff. But beyond that the fur patterns on the body looks aimless and doesn‚Äôt help the design. And to top it off in bad ‚Äústrong character‚Äù design philosophy he looks like the designed a mediocre top half and then forgot about the legs.

It's just a gut instinct, but i felt like if they stuck to SwSh way of rendering, it might have improved the looks of many of the new mons introduced in SV.

I play and love Pokemon because of the gameplay and Pokemon themselves. Scarlet and Violet have many hit and miss designs but that didn‚Äôt deter much because I ended up putting 200 hours into it. The DLC isn‚Äôt perfect, but it‚Äôs worth it in my opinion. Ogrepon alone was enough.

BluEch0,157303.0,"Prior to Gen 6, it was chosen via mathematical algorithm.

Gen 6 onward, when we started using 3d models instead of sprites, the algorithm I guess was scrapped or didn‚Äôt work on texture files the same way so shinies were chosen with intent. It‚Äôs why we got awesome shinies like white mega Gengar or funeral dress mega gardevoire.
