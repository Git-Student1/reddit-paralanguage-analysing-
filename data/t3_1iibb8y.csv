They don’t want to see us change back to a past time (hence the “again” in make America great again) they want to “progress” forward. They believed the country was on the wrong track because billionaires and corporations have too much power through Citizens United. And they likely aren’t wrong, doesn’t make sense for corporations to have unlimited lobbying power when the people are the ones who elect representatives. 

That being said, the right is the same way in many aspects. They see the country on the wrong track because it’s moving in a different direction than they want.",[],-0.5106

AnyConnection8643,1884,"My guess is because he's starting pointless trade wars with our Allies to secure an outcome that was agreed in November, and has admitted the economy is going to get worse due to his Tariffs, has allowed Elon Musk to employ literal children to DOGE, despite the supposed crackdown on DEI and is now advocating ethnic cleansing in Gaza.

New ideas are good, but batshit insane ideas... not so much. You don't have to be a democrat or radical leftist to call a spade a spade. Plenty of Republicans don't like what Trump is doing. Myself and many of them think the best case scenario is that Trump in unable to see out his full term due to his obvious ill health, and we see JD Vance and some sanity restored to the White House.",[],0.009
AdwokatDiabel,63078,"So here's the deal: YES, America has issues, and those issues cannot be resolved in the current democratic system.

1. Too much gerrymandering drives extremes in both parties.
2. FPTP system causes a lot of strategic voting issues, driving extremism.
3. The Senate filibuster also poses issues... The Senate is already an anti-populist institution, but the filibuster just makes it much...worse.
4. Our House of Representatives has failed to adjust with the population size of the US.  The last change in apportionment was in 1938.  The US population has grown considerably since then.

The issue I have is:

1. Forcing change through Executive Fiat was unpopular when Obama did it.  Compared to Trump, what he did was lightweight shit.
2. Forcing changes, destroying institutions, without Congressional approval (or debate) means we're not aware of what is going on.  The lack of transparency, debate, and discussion is dangerous.
3. The other issue I have is the use of private citizens, like Elon Musk, who have distinct conflicts of interest and lack proper vetting, to access sensitive government data, without any chain of custody, or any safeguards to protect against the misuse of that information.

What happens if Elon's seizure of Treasury Data is used to reconstruct payments for highly-secretive black projects?  We can use that data to identify things like secret nuclear materials transfers, or contractors working on top-secret shit.  One transaction is not an issue, but the aggregation of the information poses a major security risk to our nation.

Additionally, all the things DOGE is claiming to do, was all possible through acts of Congress.  Our representatives should be leading the charge here.

We have 4 years of this... and the next admin can just undo everything.  Fire DOGE, reinstate Federal workers, and then even prosecute Musk and his team for improper handling of data, and even go after the administrators who let it happen.

Which begs the question: with the potential for that much blow back, why aren't they afraid?  Sure they can get blanket pardons (of which I'm not a fan of)... which would strain the pardon process overall. Or they don't think there will be a ""next administration"" to hold them to task.

As a Republican (or someone who has reliably voted GOP for years), this is troublesome.  Because if these things come to pass, major instabilities may occur.

My fear is that instead of MAGA, America will be in a far poorer position in 4 years.  The American economy will suffer from tariff wars, we will suffer with institutional erosion and pseudoscience preferences there, and our enemies will take advantage of this moment of weakness to further divide us and eliminate us from the world stage.

If this stuff doesn't keep you up at night, I question the sincerity of the love and pride you had for this country, its history, and the work performed to make it the pre-eminent superpower in the world.

There's no guarantee that the US remains a wealthy nation or a superpower, if we squander the things that got us there in the first place.",[],-0.9938

MAGA is more interested in trolling than governing, republicans disagree with the left on a ton but they would never openly call for a complete and immediate dismantling of governmental agencies because they recognize that you can’t turn an Epic class cruise ship on a dime. Unfortunately maga continues to grab onto people though tossing them tiny inklings of value (removing income tax which will never happen, deporting people to open up jobs you’ll never work and lower home prices for houses you’d never live in anyway) and then convinces them that they were stupid for ever thinking something like that could happen.

Wait and you think it's good to be making threats like that? What if it hadn't worked? (assuming you can say it worked now) We're not gonna have many friends left if Trump keeps this up, because who would want to make a deal with us. We may be the largest economy, but we're not the only one.
