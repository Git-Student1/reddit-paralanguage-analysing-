amadeus2626,328,"""Talked to a friend who has connections within the Democratic Partyâ€œ.  Is that the highest bar that we have for a trusted information source? Shouldnâ€™t the messages that are coming be vetted? Is it smart to believe everything that is presented, especially if the messaging is trying to justify breaking the law? Could it be that this type of polarizing messaging has a completely different purpose? When did the US stop having a healthy distrust of what all politicians said? Did someone find that 50 Mil USD in Condoms, that the Whitehouse said are being distributed in Gaza?",[],0.8253

AdwokatDiabel,63078,"Let's break this ""report"" down... The Congress earmarks money to USAID.  USAID has a number of programs it supports.  These include distribution of food to countries impacted by natural disasters and such. 

To provide these services, they contract them out.  If that's the case, the paper trails for these contracts would've been public record this entire time. 

So either our party is unable to read and understand budget and contract reports or this news article is fake.  Given the lack of factual information, for example, any contract we can look at and scrutinize, I'm gonna assume that to be the case.",[],-0.1868

smauseth,34228,"I live in NC, and one of my home subs is r/northcarolina. The day before, you could see advocacy for USAID and the sub getting reading for an information campaign.  I think that with the speed that the DOGE group is proceeding, It took those guys by surprise.  The Dems and their operatives were not ready for this.

I posted this article because it seems to fit what was going on.  Like anything else on Reddit, you have to question how it is relevant but again it seems to make sense.",[],0.3601
meconiumwastaken,912,"The source had no relevant information. Didnâ€™t define USAID usage, or why dems care, pros or cons. Do you think we gain power and influence from aiding other countries or do you think we should keep our resources at home, third option keep aid at home and force other countries to allow our influence by brute force.  Policy rather than personality, would be a much better conversation.",[],0.8481
smauseth,34228,"What the US government has been good at lately in the last decade is programming you on what subjects to be outraged about.  If the data shows corruption and payoffs from USAID to elected politicians, I think that you will begin to see more anger.  The swamp creatures from both parties will need to be voted out of office or arrested depending on the severity of the crime.  At this point, the fact that they government is corrupt is a given.

Just remember, this is only week 3 of the new Trump administration.  I think that the new administration is moving with lightning speed.  I think that they'll get there.",[],-0.8588

Kewkky,113548,"Unless they ratify things in the Constitution, a blue wave can wash everything away just as efficiently as this red wave washed away all their work.

everydayimchapulin,16060,"Our government wasn't built to change so quickly at the whims of one man. You should be concerned. It should not be so easy for our current president to dismantle so much of the government that was built up over several decades. 

The next president might not be one that aligns with your beliefs, but the precedent has now been set that the American president can act unilaterally, unimpeded, and cannot be held legally accountable for their actions. 

THAT is the biggest change. Congress and the Supreme Court will be meaningless institutions and the only true power in government will lie in the executive branch.",[],0.7702
